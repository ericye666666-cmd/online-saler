# Core Data Model

This document defines the MVP logical data model. It is not yet a full Prisma
schema, but it is detailed enough to guide table design, migrations, API
contracts, permissions, and tests.

## Modeling Principles

- One second-hand clothing item equals one product and one inventory item.
- Product content readiness and inventory sale readiness are separate.
- Payment, order, inventory, fulfillment, return, and commission states are separate.
- Prices and fees are snapshotted on orders and order items.
- AI raw values must be preserved separately from human final values.
- Every high-risk change must write an audit log.
- All money values are stored in integer KSh cents or integer KSh. The MVP may
  use integer KSh if no sub-shilling precision is needed.
- Public display codes are separate from internal database ids.
- Soft deletion is preferred for business records.

## Implementation Sequence

1. Implement Foundation entities first.
2. Implement Product and media entities.
3. Implement Inventory location and item entities.
4. Implement Reservation and Order entities together.
5. Implement Payment and M-Pesa callback entities.
6. Implement Fulfillment and Return entities.
7. Implement Affiliate and Commission entities.
8. Implement AnalyticsEvent and dashboards.

## Open Modeling Decisions

These decisions require approval before schema implementation:

1. Whether money values use integer KSh or integer cents.
2. Whether customer OTP login is required before first order or only after order lookup.
3. Whether commission is fixed amount per item, percentage, or both in MVP.
4. Whether social material images are stored as `ProductImage` or a separate `MarketingAsset`.
5. Whether support tickets live in MVP or start as admin notes on order records.
